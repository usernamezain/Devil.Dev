**#Interactive Text Drawing with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS**
This project allows users to create dynamic text art by drawing letters on an HTML5 canvas with JavaScript. The text is drawn interactively as the user moves the mouse, and the letters are dynamically adjusted in size, position, and rotation based on mouse movement. This repository demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to create engaging and interactive art on the web.

**#Features**
Interactive Drawing: Draw dynamic text that follows the mouse movement.
Text Rotation & Size Variation: Letters rotate and change size based on the mouse's distance from the origin.
Responsive Canvas: The canvas automatically adjusts its size based on the window's dimensions, providing a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.
Customizable Text: Easily modify the text string in the JavaScript code to create different messages.
Canvas Reset: Double-click to clear the canvas and start drawing fresh.
**How to Use**
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.
Press and hold the mouse button while moving it across the canvas to begin drawing.
The text will be drawn dynamically with each mouse movement.
Double-click on the canvas to clear it and start over.
**Technologies Used**
